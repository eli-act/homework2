            <p><b>Orienteering</b> is an endurance sport combining mental and physical exercise. 
            There is no marked route – the orienteer must navigate the environment with map and compass while running to collect all checkpoints.
            The map provides detailed information on the terrain such as hills, ground surface, obstacles etc.</p>

            <h3>Necessary equipment</h3>
            <p>RACING SUIT: A lightweight, stretchy suit protects from undergrowth whilst allowing maximum freedom of movement even if it gets soaking wet.<br>
            SHOES: Light, strong shoes with non-slip soles allow sure grip on all types of ground – including mud and bare rock.<br>
            MAP: The map provided by the organiser shows the course with the control points which must be visited. The map is designed to give detailed information on the terrain – hills, ground surface, and features such as boulders or cliffs.<br>
            COMPASS: There is a wide variety of sophisticated compasses to choose from. Basically they can be divided into two main categories: base plate and thumb compasses.<br>
            CARD: To prove that they have visited all control points in the right order, the orienteers have to punch their control card at each control using an electronic device.</p>
